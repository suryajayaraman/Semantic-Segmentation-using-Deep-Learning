- Image segmentation -> process of classifying each pixel in an image belonging to a certain class.
- Semantic segmentation = classifying each pixel belonging to a particular label. It doesn't different across different instances of the same object. For example if there are 2 cats in an image, semantic segmentation gives same label to all the pixels of both cats
- Instance segmentation = Instance segmentation differs from semantic segmentation in the sense that it gives a unique label to every instance of a particular object in the image. As can be seen in the image above all 3 dogs are assigned different colours i.e different labels. With semantic segmentation all of them would have been assigned the same colour.
